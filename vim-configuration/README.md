## Shortcuts 
- `jj` in insert mode to switch to command mode (mapped the ESC button press)
- `ctrl + b` for running c++ code in command mode. It will open in neovim terminal and you can give input also.
- `ctrl + w` for writing the file in command mode (Need to map it so that it can be used from insert mode. But don't know how! Leave your suggestions in comment.)
